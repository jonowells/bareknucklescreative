# IBM Type

The package of IBM’s new typeface, IBM Plex, and accompanying typography code.

**Warning:** IBM Type is still in development and being carefully implemented in real cases where we can look for any difficulties. Look out for a stable v1.0.0 release in the near future.

## Typography Code

The IBM Type code provides rendering and kerning that best reflects IBM Plex. The editorial and product style sets also take care of:
- Size
- Line height
- Line length
- Bottom margin
- Weights

## How to Use

At the moment, installation requires [Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node). This will change by v1.0.0 when a CDN become available.

To install, run `npm install @ibm/type`

If you want to use the compiled css, reference the file in the dist folder:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="node_modules/@ibm/type/dist/css/ibm-type.min.css">
```

## Performance

| ibm-type.css | ibm-type.min.css | Gzipped  |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| 35kb      | 31kb      | 3kb |

Finally, each font file (~40kb) has been split into four separate files (~10kb). If your webpage does not use any unicodes from one of the four split files, the user’s device will not have to download the split file.
